\section{Results}
EMD on the 3 signals introduced in Section \ref{problem}
Using EMD we show that the 3 signals have a common weekly pattern, however, only two signals are correlated at smaller time scales.

\subsection{Data de-trending}
\begin{table*}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
× & Original data & 1st IMF & 2nd IMF & 3rd IMF & Residual\\ \hline
EHP, Light & 0.7720 & 0.4431 & 0.5104 & 0.6171 & 0.8114\\ \hline
EHP, GHP & 0.6369 & -0.0055 & 0.0883 & 0.2350 & 0.7956\\ \hline
