\section{Research Statement And Hypothesis}
\emph{What are the architectural components and technical challenges in the design of an information system
that enables new and supports old classes of applications in the built environment?}  Given the emerging applications in
the built environment it is clear that the old information system design is not sufficiently open, flexibile, nor
scalable enough to support them.  Old information systems are tightly integrated from the field-level sensor to
the central supervisor control system.  There are two integration points in traditional systems that we argue 
are either fundamentally flawed or insufficient for emerging applications.  We describe the components that 
currently exist and identify those that are missing.  We show how these components/services enable emerging applications.  We also
discuss the technical challenges that must be solved in order to provide the correct semantics for these services.
Furthermore, we discuss a component that is fundamental for providing correct information to applications 
and formalize the notion of verification in the context of the built environment.  We provide several algorithmic 
solutions to these problems, which lay the foundation for a fundamental service in the broader architecture.
