\section{Future work and conclusion}
In this paper we examined two system challenges -- mobility and consistency management -- for enabling and energy 
analytics applications in buildings.  We also 
offered initial solution approaches.  We
see these as crucial barriers to solve in order to provide the kinds of services described in Section~\ref{sec:vision}.
However, other challenges remain, particularly those related to scaling to an entire buildings, integrating
many more streaming data sources, and providing streaming analytics for immediate display to building occupants.
We see an opportunity to combine these with control in order to empower building occupants to literally take
control of their energy footprint.  The components of our architecture are simple, and simplicity is important for scale and
generalizability.  We hope that with the right tools and information, people will be motivated to act, and large
energy waste reduction can be achieved.
