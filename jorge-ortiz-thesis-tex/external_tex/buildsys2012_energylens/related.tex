Our work touches on several areas from logistics%~\cite{rfid_gonz2006} 
to context-aware 
mobile applications~\cite{ACE}.  
In the building space, there has been
some interest in building various kinds of energy-related visualization and control applications.
HBCI~\cite{hbci} proposes a high level archiecture that also relies on QR codes, mobile phones, and ubiquitous network access.  HBCI introduces 
the notion of object capture through 
the mobile phone and  individual services provides by the object, accessible via an object lookup.  The proposed service model is 
\emph{object-centric}, such as individual power traces or direct control accesss.  Their ``query'' service is a tag lookup mechanism realized through
 QR code scanning of items.  The `Energy Lens' also embodies the ``query'' via a tag lookup, however 
we focus on context-related services rather than object-centric services.  We build and maintain an entity-relationship graph (ERG) to
capture the inter-relationships between items.  The ERG informs our analytical processing.  We use an eventual-consistency model to 
maintain the inter-relationship graph over time.  HBCI does not address the challenges faced in realizing an indoor, interactive application 
that relies on ubiquitous network connectivity.  Our architecture directly addresses this challenge, as we observe that indoor connectivity characteristics do 
not comply with the ubiquitous connectivity requirement for this class of application.


% Tracking people/indoor localization
% An important aspect of the Energy Lens is determining when people and things have moved.  This requires some form 
% of indoor localization.  There's a large body of literature in the area of indoor localization with mobile phones ranging from 
% using wifi~\cite{radar}, to sonar~\cite{cricket}, to ambient noise~\cite{abs}, and a combination of sensors on the 
% phone~\cite{surroundsense}.  Dita~\cite{dita} uses acoustic localization of mobile phones and also uses the infrastructure 
% to determine gestures in free-space that are classified into pre-defined control actions.  Each of these require relatively complex 
% software and/or infrastrure.  
% We take a radically different, simple approach.  We use cheap, easy to re/produce tags (QR codes), incrementally place them on things in the 
% environment and use the natural \emph{swiping gesture} that users make, when interacting with the Energy Lens 
% application, to track when they have moved or when the objects around them have moved.  The guiding principal is to attain as much 
% information from a gesture as possible, to determine a move has occurred.  We discuss our heuristics in section~\ref{sec:tracking}.

% context-aware apps
% ACE~\cite{ACE} uses various sensors on the phone to infer a user's context.  The context domain consists of a set of user activities
% and semantic locations.  For example, ACE distinguishes between {\tt Running, Driving, AtHome, or InOffice}.  ACE can also infer 
% one from the other.  If a user is {\tt AtHome} then they are not {\tt InOffice}.  Energy Lens uses inference to determine
% when a person or thing has moved.  Certain swipe combinations give us information about whether they moved or
% whether an item moved. The main difference is that we only infer context when a user is actively swiping, rather
% than a continuous approach.  

% Prefetching is a fundamental technique used in many domains.  The cost of a prefetch for mobile
% application out-weighs the benefits if the prefetched data is not useful.  Informed mobile prefetching~\cite{imp_mobisys2012} uses cost-benefit analysis 
% to determine when to prefetch content for the user.  We prefetch data based on location swipes.
% Caching prefetched content not only improves performance and interactivity, but it is \emph{necessary} to sustain normal
% operation during periods of disconnectedness.

% Tracking things
% Logistic systems focus on tracking objects as the move from distribution sites, to warehouses, and across purchase counters.  
% Items are tracked through their unique bar codes, often embedded in an RFID.  The workload in logistic systems is very structured 
% and well defined.  The authors of~\cite{rfid_gonz2006} describe this structure and leverage it to minimize storage
% requirements and optimize query-processing performance.  The Energy Lens uses QR codes as tags and the phone as an active
% reader.  As objects move, users scan those items to their new location.  However, objects may belong to one or
% many people, they can be metered by multiple meters a day, and their history in the system
% is on-going.  In contrast, a typical logistics workload has a start (distribution site) and end point (leaving the store
% after a sale).  Our workload is less well-defined.  Furthermore, relationship semantics are important; 
% For example, we interpret a bind relationship differently from an attach relationship.  We discuss the difference
% later in the paper.

% Furthermore, we take advantage of natural gestures the user makes with the phone while scanning QR codes to extract
% information about the current location of the user or things.

% Tagging items, virtual services
% The key idea in the HP Cooltown~\cite{bridgingphysical,cooltown} work is to web-enable `things' in the world, grouped-by
% `place', and accessed by `people' via a standardized acquisition protocol (HTTP) and format (HTML, XML).  
% Cooltown creates a web presence for things in the world either directly (embedded web server) or indirectly 
% (URL-lookup tag) as a web page page that display the services it provides.  Many of the core concepts in Cooltown 
% also show up in Energy Lens.  The main overlap is the use of tags in the world that contain a reference to a virtual 
% resource, accessible via HTTP through
% a network connection.  Cooltown, however, explicitly chooses not maintain a centralized relationship
% graph, it leverages the decentralized, linking structure of the web to group associated web pages together.
% Furthermore, things are assumed to not move.  People are the main mobile entities.  The kind of applications
% we wish to support must track where things are and their specific inter-relationships.  We imposed a richer set of 
% semantics on our, centrally maintained, relationship graph and use it to provide detailed energy information.
