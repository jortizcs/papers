% \section{Architecture and system challenges}
% % The Energy Lens application aims to approximate the vision described in section~\ref{sec:vision}.  For our initial
% % atextttempt, we tagged items in a building with QR codes and allowed users to 1) tag and register new items, 
% % 2) tell us which meters are atextttached to which items, and 3) scan individual items to view their load curve over a 
% % 24-hour period.

% The architecture consists of three layers: the sensing and tag layer, the data management and processing layer, and the application
% layer.  In this section we discuss how aspects of each layer address the aforementioned challenges.
% In deploying the application in a real building, 
% we ran into various issues that informed our design.  

% For example, \emph{QR code reading times vary substantially across phones
% and lighting conditions}.  You must design for the least-common denominator in terms of camera quality and lighting.

% Another aspect to consider is network access.  Within our building, although connectivity is mostly ubiquitous, network
% access can be intermitextttent.  Network access may be unavailable for several reasons, including disassociation from an access point due
% to idleness, dead spots in the building where connectivity to both wifi and 3G/4G are unavailable, multipath-induced
% destructive interference, and various other reasons.  Dealing with these throughout the data collection and update phase is
% especially troublesome.  We discuss various mechanisms and algorithms for dealing with disconnected operation.


\section{Challenge 1: Tracking People and Things}
\label{sec:tracking}

The Energy Lens app consists of a web application that displays timeseries data and an Android-based smartphone
app.
%Figure~\ref{fig:mobileapp} shows a few of screen shots from the application.  
The android app is relatively simple; consisting of a menu with only two options: Update deployment state, scan to view services.
Swipe gestures manipualte a local portion of the entity-relationship graph -- local with respect to a user's current location.
Since each location (room, floor) has a QR code atextttached to it and items are associated with those locations, we
can identify the location by name ({\texttt /buildings/SDH/spaces/4F/toaster}).  
% Figure~\ref{fig:swipes} goes through the various sets 
% of swipes.

% \begin{figure*}[htb!]
% \begin{center}
% \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/swipes}
% \caption{Swiping gestures in the mobile application.  The registration swipe requires on a single swipe.  The 
% linking and registration gestures require two swipes, and the look-up requires a single swipe.}
% \label{fig:swipes}
% \end{center}
% \end{figure*}

The first set is called a `registration' swipe and we use it to register new items.  The user scans a QR code and the item it is atextttached
to.  This creates an `atextttached-to' link between them.  Adding, removing, binding, and atextttaching items is done with a pair of swipes.
A lookup is done with by swiping the QR code atextttached to an item.
% There are three major components in our architecture: QR codes, mobile phones, and StreamFS.

% How do we evaluate our ability to track people and things?
% This is a description evaluation.  We need to describe how the pieces interact.  What will fall out of the description is our strong dependence on occupants/users to give us information about the state of the physical world.  Itâ€™ll also fall out that what allows these pieces to fit together is network infrastructure.
We have designed a set of heuristics for setexttting the location during an update, that piggybacks on the swipe gesture.
The following is a list of rules for automatically setexttting the location of people and things:

\begin{itemize}
\item When a user swipes at a location L, they are presumed to be at L for fixed period $\tau$.  An ``association timer'' is set to 
        release this association after $\tau$ seconds.
\item If the user swipes anything that is associated with a location $l$ at time $t \le \tau$, and $l(t)\ne$ L, 
        then we set the new location of the \emph{thing} they swiped to l(t) and reset the association timer.
\item If the user swipes anything at location l at time $t \ge \tau$, we set the location of the \emph{person} to l(t).
        We reset the association timer to $\tau$.
\item If a user registers a new location, they are presumed to be at that location.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.08in}


For each of these, we provide an interactive option to ask for location-change confirmation from the user.  So if we think the
user/item has moved but they have not, the preset action can be overridden.  The guiding principal we follow in our design
is to leverage the swipe gesture for as much contextual information as possible.  Furthermore, we do not explicitly track users.
Context is only set on the phone and used in operations sent to the server.  
% We then construct an entity relationship graph through 
% naming in StreamFS.  StreamFS uses filesystem constructs, such as hierarchical naming and symbolic
% links, which we use to express an acyclic relationship-graph structure.

%  which you are either editing directly or
% adding creating/destroying a relationship link in the graph.

% Because location swipes give us direct confirmation of a user's location, it can be coupled with wifi localization mechanisms
% and supervised learning algorithms to adjust the localization model as the user interacts with their environment. 
% For future work we intend to experiment with this mechanism.% to enable supervised-learning-based indoor wifi localization.


% \subsubsection{QR code design}
% \label{sec:qrc}
% Our choice to use QR codes is important, since the \emph{only way to scale -- in deployment size and management complexity -- is to
% involve building occupants}. QR codes are cheap to produce.  They can be printed and atextttached to items with tape or sticky paper.  
% Figure~\ref{fig:qrcexsecond} shows an example QR code used in our deployment.  These are placed on physical
% objects and spaces throughout the building to link between the physical world and our virtual representation of it.

% % With the number of physical objects and places in a building, \emph{we must rely on the occupants
% % to scale our deployment and manage it over}. Because QR codes are easy to produce, we provide occupants with a webpage that
% % that produces them.  They print them out, place them on items or places they want to interact with and register them.

% Since occupants are our target users, we must make the application easy to use.  For QR code usage, varied lighting conditions, 
% phone-specific camera quality, and shaky hand movements can make scanning cumbersome; ultimately de-motivating continued use.  
% QR codes must be designed to minimize scanning time.  In our initial deployment and experiments we observe
% that complex QR code code not only have an longer average scanning time but also experience a larger variance in scanning time.  
% The more complex the pixel design in the QR code, the harder it is for the camera to focus and capture it. 


% We scanned each QR code shown in Figure~\ref{fig:qrcexcomp}, under light and dark lighting conditions.  
% Each experiment was run 10 times and Table~\ref{tab:qrscans} shows a statistical summary.  Scanning the simple QR code under well-lit 
% conditions performed the best.  The complex QR code under  the same condition takes about 28-36\% longer to scan.
% Perhaps even more important is the variance.  Notice that the variance with the simple QR code is smaller.
% QR code image complexity increases with the amount of information you encode on it.  Therefore, it was important to decrease the
% amount of information we encoded, \emph{placing the complexity in the lookup rather than the tag.}

% \caption{Shows the time to scan a long QR code versus a short QR code in light and dark conditions (loosely defined).

% \end{center}

% \end{table}

% Table~\ref{tab:qrscans} shows the results of some simple scanning experiment between the two tags
% shown above.  We scanned each QR code under light and dark lighting conditions, off the screen of my laptop.
% Each experiment was run 10 times and the table shows the statistical
% overview of the results. 
% Clearly, scanning the simple QR code under well-lit conditions
% performed the best.  The complex QR code under the same condition takes about 28-36\% longer to scan.
% On a generic QR code scanner, as used here, there is a portion of the
% scan time that is independent of the code complexity.  As these are
% more heavily used, this is expected to be reduced substantially and
% the difference is acquisition complexity will be even more pronounced.
% Perhaps even more important is the variance.  Notice that the variance with the simple QR code is much smaller and
% more stable under either condition.  In our experience, {\bf large variance in scan time is a major
% problem for complex QR codes}.  Thus we decided to re-design our codes and push more information in the lookup
% processes, as network access was more reliable than the focus of the camera on various mobile devices.
% Tags are placed on all types of devices in all kinds of locations with varying degrees of lighting.
% Simple QR codes are vital for widespread use.

% The design choice forced us to examine others that were related.  Not being able to encode much information on 
% our QR codes means we are more reliant on the network to provide the bulk of the information, to be very reliable,
% and to be widespread enough that disconnection is not problematic.  Moreover, there are a number of clients
% that can be used to access and display the information and the tag has to be meaningful for both.
% In order to meet these criteria we (1) shrunk {\texttt URL}'s using tinyURL~\cite{tinyurl} as a level of 
% indirection and 
% (2) designed two classes of applications: \emph{shallow} applications, and \emph{deep-inspection} applications.  Shallow
% applications interact with the web-application directly while deep-inspection application use
% the {\texttt URL} of the web application to extract a unique identifier and provide deeper inspection
% and update capabilities of the entity-relationship graph.

% This is an example {\texttt URL} we used in our deployment: {\texttt htextttp://tinyurl.com/6235eyw}.
% When resolved, we get an empty response in the body, but we use the header to identify the QR code identifier 
% that we associate with the item.  The response header is down in Figure~\ref{fig:tinyurlhdr}.

% \begin{figure}[htb!]
% \begin{center}
% \includegraphics[scale=0.30]{figs/tinyurlhdr}
% \caption{The header of the response from the {\texttt tinyUrl} when resolving a QR code.  The `Location' atextttribute
% is used to extract the unique identifier for the object this QR code tags.  It is also used to re-direct
% users without the phone application to a meaningful web address for the object.}
% \label{fig:tinyurlhdr}
% \end{center}
% \end{figure}


% Notice the `Location' atextttribute in the header.  This is the location of the re-direct.  This approach gives us
% flexibility in several ways:

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item It allows us to encode less information in the QR code, decreasing its visual complexity; making it more
% 		robust across phones with different camera quality, poor lighting conditions, and shaky hands.
% \item It allows the added layer of indirection to serve two versions of the applications:  the native application,
% 		where users can \emph{deeply explore} and edit the entities and their relationships and the \emph{shallow lookup}, 
% 		which re-directs the mobile phone to a read-only view of the item that was scanned -- such as a power trace or 
% 		a description.
% \end{enumerate}


% It provides a web address for users to re-direct to and find information and various read-only services for the object.  However, because
% the {\texttt URL} also contains a unique identifier \emph{qrc}, it can be used to provide for sophisticated services and capabilities.
% An example is the ability to change the virtual structure of inter-relationship between this object and other objects.  This
% is demonstrated in our energy auditing application discussed in detail in section~\ref{sec:eaudit}.
% Once items are tagged, they can be added and removed by swiping the tag and pressing the butexttton for what you want to do with
% the item.  You also check into locations either explicit with a location-tag swipe or implicitly with an item swipe.

% \emph{Shallow} applications
% use the {\texttt URL} directly.  The \emph{qrc} {\texttt URL} is unqiue identifier for the item that this tag is atextttached to.
% A shallow application can obtain mostly read-only service through our web applications.  For example, we'll see how
% to get either item-specific data or item-aggregated data with respect to the user making the request (i.e. the total
% energy consumed by \emph{my} devices).  \emph{Deep-inspection} applications are native to the phone, so we can do much
% more with the tag.  Our energy auditing application allows you to related the item to other items by maintaining state of swipe
% history.  This is more difficult with the web-applicaiton.  We can also use the tag and item information to couple it with
% sensor information coming from sensors on the phone itself.  For example, we could determine the direction an object
% is pointing by using the phone's directional sensor and negating their direction (i.e. phone is facing east, tag on item must
% be facing west).

% \begin{figure*}[htb!]
% \begin{center}
% \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/mobileapp}
% \caption{Screen shots of the mobile application.  The screens on the left are for editing the state of the deployment.
% The graph on the right shows a live feed of a the sensor that's atextttached to the item that was scanned with the `Scan To
% View Services' option in the mobile application.  It can also be resolved by scanning the QR code and following the re-direct
% to the URL.}
% \label{fig:mobileapp}
% \end{center}
% \end{figure*}

% ACme meters are IP-enabled and forward their data through a router that runs sMAP.  sMAP then forwards the incoming data
% to StreamFS, running in a machine in Amazon's EC2.  StreamFS is a web service that organizes streaming data and metadata using
% a hierarchical naming convention.  It also provide a pub/sub facility for streaming data.  We construct 
% a canonical naming convention within StreamFS to express the entity relationships between people, things, and meters.  The pub/sub
% mechanism allows us to combine the ERG with streaming data, and feeds our timeseries data viewers.

% \subsubsection{Entity-Relationship graph}
We construct the entity relationship graph through naming in StreamFS.  StreamFS uses filesystem constructs, such as symbolic
links and hierarchical naming which are useful for expressing an acyclic graph structure (StreamFS checks for cycles when symlinks 
are created).  
% The following general path-naming patexttterns are used to express different portions of the ERG.
% % $/path/to/device\_or\_item$, 
% % $/path/to/qrc$, $/path/to/space$, $/path/to/taxonomy$, $/path/to/users$.  
Registered meters are placed in the device path, {\texttt /dev}.  Items are stored in {\texttt /inventory}.  QR codes are stored 
in {\texttt /qrc}.  When an item is registered a 
symbolic link is created from the specific qr code directory to the item.  {\texttt /spaces} contains a hierarchy of floors, rooms, 
and sub-spaces.  {\texttt /users} contains the list of usernames.  We also have a {\texttt /tax} directory, where we construct an
device hierarchy for access by plug-load category.  Placement (location) is also captured with symbolic links. 

\section{Challenge 2: Consistency Management}
We use an eventual-consistency model for maintaining the ERG over time.  Naturally, the spatial inter-relationships
change over time as items are moved and replaced.  In order to deal with this we offer two options: 1) we periodically
re-scan the items and their locations, essentially re-capturing the inventory collection portion of the audit or
2) we allow building occupants to participate as auditors, capturing their own personal items and shared items.
This should provide at least as much value as a periodic energy audit and can be completed in a fraction of the 
time~\cite{aceee_mobileaudit}.

% Placement (location) is captured with symbolic links as well.
% Node types inform the application of the nature of the relationship.  We define five distinct types: item, meter, 
% location, category, and tag.  The following relationships are constructed with symlinks between different node types:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\bf Owned-by}: When a meter/item/location is tagged as belonging to a user.
% \item {\bf Bound-to}: When a meter is atextttached to an item and taking physical measurements associated with that 
% 		device, we say that the meter is ``bound-to'' the device.
% \item {\bf Atextttached-to}: When a meter/qr code/item is atextttached to another meter/qr code/item but \emph{not} taking any 
% 		physical measurements for that item, we say that the meter/item is ``atextttached-to'' the other meter/qr 
% 		code/item.  QR codes cannot not be atextttached to each other.
% \item {\bf Is-in}: When a meter/item is inside a location, we say that the meter/item ``is-in'' that location.
% \item {\bf Type-of}: When an item is labeled by as a known, specific, type, we say that the item is a ``type-of'' thing 
% 		specified by the its label.
% \end{itemize}

% All symlinks are interpreted based on these rules of association.  As items move, symlinks are removed and re-created
% in a different folder.  We know your current location by following the path from the QR code directory, across a symlink, 
% to a file in the space directory.  Items associated with a space have a floor or room folder point to the item
% via a symlink.  This is how we record the location of things throughout the building.

% \begin{figure}[htb!]
% \begin{center}
% \includegraphics[scale=0.55]{figs/bindatextttachstructs}
% \caption{This diagram shows the relationship capture between the objects and locations in the building for the 
% energy audit application.  Children of a space node have an ``is-in'' relationship with the space.  An item
% with another item as a child have a ``atextttached'' relationship and meters atextttached to items are bound to each other.
% Note, this is a \emph{subset} of the relationship diagrams generated across our three applications.}

%\subsection{Application layer}

% \caption{A portion of the prefetched entities on the a single floor in our building.  This shows a snapshot of the entity-relationship

% tag or anything on that floor.}
% \label{fig:sdh_4f_erg}
% \end{center}
% \end{figure}




\section{Challenge 3: Disconnected Operation}
Although connectivity is ubiquitous, network access is not.  This occurs due to dead zones, 
idle-disconnect and failed hand-off between access points.  When encountered in practice, especially while editing
deployment state, it can be quite frustrating and discourage use of the application.  We designed a
mechanism that does smart caching, not only to improve performance, but also to allow for disconnected operation.

% The Energy Lens application downloads a portion of the ERG when a user enters a new floor.  The application fetches the portion
% of the graph rooted at the floor.  
% Figure~\ref{fig:sdh_4f_erg} shows just a small portion of that entity-relationship graph for the floor we are monitoring in
% our deployment.  
% A prefetch populates the cache with all entity nodes on that floor, their associated metadata,
% and 30 minutes of data from the stream entities.  The full fetch of the 4th floor data set includes
% 176 nodes and about 1 MB of meter data.  In total, the app downloads ~1.2 MB of data upon re-connection.
% Prefetching allows users to continue interacting with the application as if they were still connected (as long as they remain on
% the same floor).  Without it, the application is not functional until a network connection is established.

% \begin{algorithm}
% \caption{Prefetch Loop}
% \label{alg:prefetch}
% 	\begin{algorithmic}
% 	\While {true}
% 	\If {connected and active}
% 	    \State $req\gets [t_{i-n}, OP_R]$
% 	    \State $resp\gets $ send($req$)=$[t_{i-k}, OP_R],\dots, [t_{now}, OP_R]; $ 
% 	    \State $n >= k$
% 	    \For {$j = 1 \to size(resp)}$
% 	    	\State $op \gets$ $resp[j]=[t_{i-k+e}, OP_R]$
% 	    	\State apply($op$)
% 	    \EndFor
% 	\EndIf
% 	\If {active}
% 		\State Sleep for 10 minutes
% 	\Else
% 		\State Sleep for 1 hour
% 	\EndIf
% 	\EndWhile
% 	\end{algorithmic}
% \end{algorithm}


% The Energy Lens periodically syncs with StreamFS to obtain updates to the ERG and maintain a locally consistent view.  
% Let $OP_R$ be an operation performed on the node rooted at node $R$ and $t_i$ be the current time on the phone.  
% % Algorithm~\ref{alg:prefetch} shows the pseudo code for the prefetch process.  
% After a set period, the phone sends the server
% its last performed operation and the time that operation was performed.  The server responds with any operations that have
% take place since then.  The client applies those operations internally to the cached version of the the ERG in order to 
% maintain consistency.  The ``\emph{active}'' parameter-check, is for energy savings.  If the phone application is active, the
% check occurs every 10 minutes, otherwise it occurs ever hour.

The process is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:interactions}.  The components shown are the \emph{ERG cache}, the \emph{operation
log (OpLog)}, and the \emph{prefetcher}.  We separate the steps in the figure as a READ sequence and a WRITE sequence.
All reads go to the cache (steps 1 and 2 on the left hand side of the figure).  Writes go through the OpLog (steps 1 - 5 on the right
side of the figure).  For writes, 
the application makes a write request (1) and it is forwarded to StreamFS (2).  If StreamFS is reachable and the write is
successful (3), the operation is applied to the ERG cache (4) and the response is sent the application (5).
If the operation is not successfuly, step 4 is skipped.  If StreamFS could not be reached, step 3 is skipped, and the operation
is writexttten to the OpLog.  The OpLog is flushed to the server, by the prefetcher, upon re-connection. 

% The OpLog contains records of operations that are eventually applied to StreamFS.  Some of those operations
% are actually groups of operations that need to be applied atomically.  For example, 
% when a bind or atextttach operation occurs, we append the timestamp to the item(s) that are being connected, as well as create
% a link between them in the graph.  The application uses both the link and the added metadata to fetch the appropriate
% graph for display.  These operations must be applied atomically or not be applied at all.
% When the log is dumped, the global transaction manager (GTXM) -- the layer that handles log dumps and transaction processing --
% atextttempts to apply the log in timestamp order.


\begin{figure}[htb!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{figs/standard_interaction}
\caption{Standard mechanisms for consistency management on the phone.  All READ request go to the local
cached version of the ERG.  All WRITES must go through the OpLog.}
% They are eventually applied to the cache
% if successful and logged if the StreamFS is unreachable.
\label{fig:interactions}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

% \subsubsection{Log dumps and conflict resolution}
% \label{sec:conflicts}
% When the Energy Lens application is started it contacts the server and atextttains the server's local clock time. 
% It notes its local time as being equal to the timestamp of the server and calculates all subsequent timestamps
% using its local clock.  When an operation or transaction is added to the OpLog, a timestamp is appended.  Let $t_s$ be the timestamp 
% on the server, $t_l$ be the timestamp on the phone when $t_s$ is recorded, and $t_{now}$ be the current time on the phone.  
% Each operation/transaction is timestamped with $t_{approx}$ where:

% \begin{equation}
% t_{approx} = t_s + (t_{now} - t_l)
% \end{equation}

% This timestamp is a general approximation of when the operation should be applied on the server.  The server applies 
% these is ascending timestamp order.

% Generally, a conflict occurs if there is any operation or transaction that was applied after the timestamp of the current operation
% being processed.  A typical transaction manager must rollback the state of the database, apply the operation, and replay
% the log.  However, conflict resolution is much simpler in this context.  \emph{The latest operations reflect the state of the
% world because they are updates induced by direct interaction with the world at that point in time.}  Therefore, if there is a conflict
% between a set of operations, the old ones can all be discarded.



% Operations that are discarded are done so silently.  We make failures silent for two reasons: 1) There is no way to contact the app when 
% failure occurs.  Mobile phones
% do not often have reversably reachable addresses.  2) Failure assumes the operation was based on a false assumption about the state
% of the world.  



% \subsection{Real-time analytics}

% Figure~\ref{fig:tsdata} shows three screen shots of power traces obtained from the ACme deployment, and displayed
% through the Energy Lens.  Notice that there is
% some data missing in the graph.  This occurs because of in the network transmission, reboots on the data management layer,
% or failed scripts that are automatically restarted.  In all cases we get holes in the data.  To compute aggregates, interpolation 
% is necessary.  StreamFS offers a real-time processing facility, whereby javascript operaters can be applied
% to streaming data.  This allows us to clean it as it comes in and compute the aggregate traces.  We are currently experimenting
% with various aggregation models to give occupants deeper insights.  
\section{Deployment Experience}
\label{sec:eval}

We deployed 20 ACme power meters~\cite{acme} on a single floor of a building on campus.  The data was made available through
sMAP~\cite{smap} and forwarded to our processing and data management layer, StreamFS~\cite{streamfs}.  We distributed
the ACmes throughout a single floor in our building and registered various plug loads as being measured by them.  We also tagged
hundreds of items and locations throughout the entire building.  In total we tagged 20 meters, 20 metered items, 351 un-metered items,
 and 139 rooms over 7 floors.  Figure~\ref{fig:tsdata} shows three screen shots of power traces obtained from the ACme deployment, and displayed
 through the Energy Lens. 

\begin{figure}[htb!]
\begin{center}

a building on campus.  These show screen shots of the Energy Lens timerseries data display.}
\label{fig:tsdata}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

In our initial deployment we found that the use of our tracking scheme to be effective, especially in conjunction with
interactive confirmation.  The ERG was effective at capturing deployment state, although highly mobile items, such as laptops,
were particularly difficult to keep track of.  Finally, our disconnected operation mechanism was effective at masking 
intermitextttent connectivity.  For future work we will baseline the floor's energy consumption before and after the deployment 
and measure if more visibility and analytics indeed motivates occupants to use less.
