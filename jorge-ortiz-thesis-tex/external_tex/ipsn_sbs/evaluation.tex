\section{Experimental Results}
\label{eval}
In this section we evaluate SBS on our building traces.  We demonstrate
 the benefits of striping the data by monitoring patterns captured at different time scales.
Then, we thoroughly investigate the alarms reported by SBS.  

\subsection{Shortcomings}
Because our analysis is done on historical data, some of the faults found by SBS could not be fully
corroborated.  In order to fully examine the effectiveness of our approach, we must run it in real time and
physically check that the problem is actually occurring.  When a problem is detected
in the historical trace, months after it has occurred, the current state of the building may no longer reflect
what is in the traces.  Some of the anomalies discussed in this section uncover interpretable patterns 
that are difficult to find in practice.  For example, simultaneous heating and cooling is a known, recurring problem
 in buildings, but it is very hard to identify  when it is occurring.  Some of the anomalies we could not interpret
might be interpretable by a building manager, however, we did not consult either building manager for this study.
Therefore, the results of this study do not examine the true/false positive rate exhaustively.

The true/false negative rate is impractical to assess.  It may be examined through synthetic stimulation of
the building via the control system.  However, getting cooperation from a building manager to hand over control of the building
for experimentation in non-trivial.  Therefore, we forgo a full true/false negative analysis in our evaluation.

Because of these challenges, the evaluation of SBS focuses on comparing the output with known fault
signatures.  We examine anomalies, in either building, where the anomaly is easily interpretable but
difficult to find by the building manager.  We forego a comparison of SBS with competing algorithms because
 related algorithms require detailed knowledge of the building, \emph{a priori}.  The advantage of SBS is that it 
requires no such information to provide immediate value.

\subsection{Device behavior at different time scales}
The Strip and Bind part of SBS is evaluated using the data from Eng. Bldg 2. %, since we can verify how items are being used and use it as ground truth.
This dataset is appropriate to measure SBS's performance, since lighting and HVAC systems serving the same room are usually used 
simultaneously.
Consequently, we analyze this data using SBS and verify that the higher correlations at medium frequencies correspond to devices located in the same room. % and the unwanted data is captured at the other frequencies.

The dataset is split into 10, one-week bins and each bin is processed by SBS.
Using the 10 correlation matrices at each time scale range, SBS uncovers the four reference matrices depicted in 
Figure~\ref{fig:heatmap}.

\paragraph{High frequencies}
In this work the high frequencies correspond to the signals \emph{noise}, 
therefore, we do not expect any useful information from the corresponding matrix (Figure \ref{fig:heatmap:high}).
Indeed, the corresponding reference matrix does not provide any help to determine a device's relative location.
Thus, we emphasize that high frequency data should be ignored for uncovering device relationships (in contrast to \cite{romain:iotapp12}).
Interestingly, we find that the sensors monitoring the lights generate consistent noise. % and could help one to cluster this type of sensor.
  
\paragraph{Medium frequencies}
Our main focus is on the medium frequencies as it is designed to capture the intrinsic device relationships.
Figure \ref{fig:heatmap:med} shows the correlation matrix at medium frequencies.
It is significantly different from the one obtained with the raw signals (Figure \ref{fig:heatmap:raw}): high correlation coefficients are concentrated along the matrix diagonal. 
Since devices serving the same or adjacent rooms are placed nearby in the matrix it validates our hypothesis: \emph{high correlation scores within the medium frequency band shows strong inter-device relationships}.

Considering this reference matrix as an adjacency matrix of a graph, in which the nodes are the devices, we identify the clusters of 
correlated devices using a community mining algorithm~\cite{blondel:unfolding}.
As expected we obtain mainly clusters of only two devices (light and HVAC serving the same room), but we also find clusters that are composed of more devices.
For example a cluster contains 3 HVAC systems serving the three server rooms. Although these server rooms are located on
 different floors, SBS shows a strong correlation between these devices.  Coincidentally, they are managed similarly.
Interestingly, we also observe a couple of clusters that consist of independent devices serving adjacent rooms belonging to the same lab.
The bigger cluster contains 33 devices that are 2 GHP devices and the corresponding lights.
This correlation matrix and the corresponding clusters 
highlight the ability for SBS to identify such hidden inter-device usage relationships.
 
\paragraph{Low frequencies}
Low frequencies capture daily patterns, embedded in all the device traces.  
Figure \ref{fig:heatmap:low} depicts the corresponding reference matrix which is similar to the one of raw signal traces (Figure \ref{fig:heatmap:raw}) 
and it shows no particular structure.% (daily patterns account for the coefficients high values).  
% Since this matrix contains mainly high values, most of the partial signals at low frequencies features similar characteristics (i.e. daily patterns).
These partial signals are discarded as they do not help us in identifying inter-device usage patterns.
 
\paragraph{Residual data}
The residual data shows the weekly trend, which gives us no information about device relationships.
But, surprisingly, by reordering the correlation matrix based on the type of the devices (Figure \ref{fig:heatmap:res}) 
we can visually identify two major clusters.
The first cluster consists of HVAC devices (see EHP and GHP in Figure \ref{fig:heatmap:res}) and the second one contains only lights. 
An in-depth examination of the data reveals that long-term trends are inherent to the device types. 
For example, as the consumption of both the EHP and GHP devices is driven by the building occupancy and the outside temperature, these two types of devices follow the same trend. 
However, the use of light is independent from the outside temperature thus the lighting systems follow a common trend different from the EHP and GHP one.

We conduct the same experiments by splitting the dataset in 70 bins of 1 day long and observe analogous results at high and medium frequencies but not at lower frequencies.  This is because the bins are too short to exhibit daily oscillations and the residual data captures only the daily trend.

% TODO add some info about the reference matrix for the Building 2?

\subsection{Anomalies}
We evaluate the \emph{search} performance of SBS using the traces from the Eng. Bldg 2 and Cory Hall.
%% Romain
Due to the lack of historical data, such as room schedule or reports of energy waste, the evaluation is non-trivial.
Furthermore, getting ground truth data from a manual inspection of the hundreds traces of our data sets is impractical.
The lack of ground truth data prevents us from producing a systematic analysis of the anomalies missed by SBS (i.e. false negatives rate).
Nevertheless, we exhibit the relevance of the anomalies uncovered by SBS (i.e. high true positive rate and low false positive rate) by manually checking the output of SBS.
%% Romain

\paragraph{Anomaly classification}
To validate SBS results we manually inspect the anomalies detected by the algorithm.  
For each reported alarm $(t,i)$ we investigate the device trace $i$ and the devices correlated to it
to determine the reason for the alarm.
Specifically, we retrieve the major relationship change that causes the alarm (i.e. $\max(|w_j(C_{i,j}^t - R_{i,j})|)$, 
see Section \ref{methodo:ano}) and examine the metadata associated to the corresponding device.
% $j$ and the sign of the relationship change $C_{i,j}^t - R_{i,j}$.
% A positive value of relation change means the devices correlation at the time bin $t$ is abnormally high, whereas negative value means that the relationship between the two devices is broken.
This investigation allows us to classify the alarms into five groups:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{High power usage}: alarms corresponding to electricity waste.
 \item \emph{Low power usage}: alarms representing the abnormally low electricity consumption of a device.
 \item \emph{Punctual abnormal usage}: alarms standing for short term (less than 2.5 hours) raise or drop of the electricity consumption.
 \item \emph{Missing data}: alarms raised due to a sensor failure.
 \item \emph{Other}: alarms whose root cause is unclear.
\end{itemize}

% However, the exhaustive enumeration of the true negatives (i.e. saving opportunities that are not detected) is impractical because of the size of the analyzed datasets (number of devices and traces length).
% Instead we exhibit the detector sensitivity by varying $\tau$, the threshold value.

\label{tab:classif}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Experimental setup}
For each experiment, the data is split in time bins of one day, starting from 09:00 a.m. -- which is approximately 
the office's opening time.
We avoid having bins start at midnight since numerous anomalies appear at night and they are better highlighted if they are 
not spanning two time bins.
Only the data at medium frequencies are analyzed, the other frequency bands are ignored, and the reference matrix is computed from all time bins.


The threshold $\tau$ tunes the sensitivity of SBS, hence, the number of reported alarms.  
Furthermore, by plotting the number of alarms against the value of $\tau$ for both datasets (Figure \ref{fig:thres}) we observe an 
elbow in the graph around $\tau=5$.
With thresholds lower than this pivot value ($\tau<5$), the number of alarms significantly increases, causing less important anomalies 
to be reported.  
For higher values ($\tau>5$), the number of alarms is slowly decreasing, providing more conservative results that consist of the 
most important anomalies.
This pivot value provides a good trade off for either data set.

Table \ref{tab:classif} classifies the alarms reported by SBS on both datasets.
 Anomalies spanning several time bins (or involving several devices) may raise several alarms.  We display these in Table \ref{tab:classif} 
 as numbers in brackets -- the number of anomalies corresponding to the reported alarms.
%Due to page limitation the following sections only present the most typical and interesting anomalies identified by SBS.

\subsubsection{Engineering Building 2}


SBS reported 55 alarms over the 10 weeks of the Eng. Bldg 2 dataset.
However, 36 alarms are set aside because of sensor errors; one GHP has missing data for the first 18 days.
Since this device is highly correlated to the GHP in the reference matrix, their relationship is broken for the 18 first bins and 
for each bin one alarm per device is raised.

\caption{Example of alarms (red rectangles) reported by SBS on the Cory Hall dataset}
\end{figure*}

In spite of the post-Fukushima measures to reduce Eng. Bldg 2's energy consumption, 
SBS reported 9 alarms corresponding to high power usage (Table \ref{tab:classif}).
Figure \ref{fig:res:eng1} depicts the electricity consumption of the light and EHP in the same room where two alarms are raised.
Because the EHP was not used during daytime (but is turned on at night, when the light is turned off) the relationship between the two devices 
is ``broken'' and an alarm is raised for each device.
Figure \ref{fig:res:eng2} shows another example of energy waste.  The light is on at night and the EHP is off.
The top-priority anomaly reported by SBS is caused by the 10 days long constant use of an EHP (Figure \ref{fig:res:eng4}) and this 
waste of electricity accounts for 165 kWh.
SBS partially reports this anomaly but lower values of $\tau$ permits us to identify most of it.


We observed 6 alarms corresponding to abnormally low power use.  Upon further inspection we notice that it corresponds to energy saving
 initiatives from the occupants -- likely due to electricity concerns in Japan.
This behavior is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:res:eng3}.  The room is occupied at the usual office hours (indicated by light usage)  but the 
EHP is not on in order to save electricity.

\subsubsection{Cory Hall}
SBS reported 39 alarms for the Cory Hall dataset (Table \ref{tab:classif}).
 7 are classified as low power usage, however, our inspection revealed that the root causes are different than for the Eng. Bldg 2 dataset.
We observe that the low power usage usually corresponds to device failures or misconfiguration.  
For example, Figure \ref{fig:res:cory1} depicts the electricity consumption of the $2^{nd}$ floor chiller and a power riser that comprises the consumption of multiple systems, including the chiller.
As the chiller suddenly stops working, the correlation between both measurements is significantly altered and an alarm for each device is raised.

SBS also reports 25 alarms corresponding to high power usage. 
One of the identified anomalies is particularly interesting.
We indirectly observe abnormal usage of a device from the power consumption of the elevator and a power panel for equipment from 
the $1^{st}$ to the $4^{th}$ floor.
Figure~\ref{fig:res:cory21} and~\ref{fig:res:cory22} show the electricity consumption for both devices. 
SBS uncovers the correlation between the these two signals, as the amount of electricity going through the panel fluctuates along with the elevator power consumption (Figure \ref{fig:res:cory22}).
In fact, the elevator is a good indicator of the building's occupancy.
Anomalous energy-consumption is identified during a weekend as the consumption measured at the panel is independently fluctuating from the elevator usage.
These fluctuations are caused by a device that is not directly monitored.  Therefore, we could not identify the root cause more precisely. 
 Nevertheless, the alarm is worthwhile for building operators to start investigating.

The most important anomaly identified in Cory Hall is shown in Figure \ref{fig:res:cory3}.
This anomaly corresponds to the malfunctioning of the HVAC heater serving the $4^{th}$ and $5^{th}$ floors. 
The heater is constantly working for 18 consecutive days, regardless of the underlying occupant activity.
Moreover, in order to maintain appropriate temperature this also results in an increase of the $4^{th}$ floor HVAC chiller power consumption 
and several fans, such as the one depicted in Figure \ref{fig:res:cory3}.
This situation is indicative of simultaneous heating and cooling -- whereby heating and cooling systems are competing -- and it 
is a well-know problem in building management that leads to significant energy waste.
For this example, the electricity waste is estimated around 2500 kWh for the heater.
Nevertheless, as the anomaly spans over 18 days, it is hidden in the building's overall consumption, thus, it is difficult to detect 
by building administrators without SBS.
