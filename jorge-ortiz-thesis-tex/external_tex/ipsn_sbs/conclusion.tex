\section{Conclusions}
The goal of this article is to assist building administrators in identifying misbehaving devices in large building sensor
deployments.  
We proposed an unsupervised method to systematically detect abnormal energy consumption in buildings: the Strip, Bind, and Search (SBS) method.
SBS uncovers inter-device usage patterns by striping dominant trends off the devices energy-consumption trace.
Then, it monitors device usage and reports devices that deviate from the norm.  
Our main contribution is to develop an unsupervised technique to uncover the true inter-device relationships that are hidden by noise and 
dominant trends inherent to the sensor data.  
SBS is used on two sets of traces captured from two buildings with fundamentally different infrastructures.
The abnormal consumption identified in these two buildings are mainly energy waste.
The most important one is an instance of a competing heater and cooler that caused the heater to waste around 2500~kWh.
