Online analytical processing (OLAP) is a processing layer that provides summurization of data
from a set of underlying data repository (date warehouses).  Traditionally, OLAP is used to process
business data.  Business data summurization allows an analyst ask targetted questions about aggregates 
and trends in their data.  The data is typically multidimensional in nature and operations can be performed with
respect to those dimensions and their inter-relationship.
