\subsection{Namespaces}
StreamFS manages two namespaces.  The first is a flat namespaces that identifies a particular
object instance.  The second is a hiearchical namespace that identifies the current instance
of a particular object.  In this section, we discuss why we have two namespaces, how
they are managed, and how they are used by the query interface and analytical layer.

\subsubsection{Object identifier namespace}
Each new object that's created is assigned a 128-bit unique identifier:

\begin{itemize}
\item 96 high-order bits identify the object
\item 32 low-order bits identify the version of the object
\end{itemize}

In this paper we concentrate on the high-order bits used to identify the object.  Management of the low-order
bits is the subject of related, ongoing work.
