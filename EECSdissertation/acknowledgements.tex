You can put whatever you want in your acknowledgements, including photos, text, etc. The only requirement is that it follow the correct margins, double spacing, and page numbering requirements. Beyond that, write as much or as little as you would like in order to thank the people who helped you out. You might even want to acknowledge the writer of this template!
