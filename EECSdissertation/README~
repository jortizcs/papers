This is a thesis template for use with LaTeX 2e. 
I used PDFLaTeX and the MacOS X application TeXShop. Your mileage may vary. Be sure to check to make sure that the format of the thesis requirements
have not changed. This was correct as of Fall 2004.

 place to look for things you might consider changing (like included packages,
margins)

   uc10.clo -- sub-file for setting font size to 10pt
   uc11.clo -- 11 pt
   uc12.clo -- 12 pt

   IEEEtranS.bst -- A version of IEEEtran.bst that sorts the entries. May be of interest for (non-IEEE) work such as theses. (Do not use for IEEE work.)  You can also use another .bst file if you want.
