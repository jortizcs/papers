Dear Coauthor,

I'm hoping to file my dissertation around the end of August. I would like to
include our recent JGR paper as a chapter in my dissertation. If you feel like
this is acceptable, I will need your permission. I attached the text of an 
acceptable letter of support. Could you please print out this letter on a sheet
of letterhead, sign it, and send it back to me via fax. Then, please put a copy
in the regular mail to me, in case they need an original (the letter has to go
through me, so do NOT send anything directly to the dean's office).

	fax: 510.643.9980 (use cover sheet)

Re: Permission to reproduce co-authored material in dissertation

Dear Dean Mason;

	I have conducted collaborative research with &lt;Delilah Gradstudent&gt; 
(Student ID: 12345678) while she has been a graduate student at the University 
of California, Berkeley. Her contributions to our work represent an integral 
component of the research and worthy of inclusion in his dissertation. I give 
her permission to reproduce our co-authored work in her dissertation.

Sincerely,


Dr. Coauthor V. Publishalot
University of South Babylon
