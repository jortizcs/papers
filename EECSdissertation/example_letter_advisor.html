research under my supervision while she has been a graduate student at 
the University of California, Berkeley. She has also collaborated with 
several researchers outside the University and produced co-authored 
publications with those individuals. I have reviewed this work and it
is comparable to work conducted under the direct supervision of a Berkeley
faculty member. &lt;Delilah&gt; conducted an integral component of the research. 
The two chapters based on publication with Dr. &lt;Publishalot&gt; are worthy of 
inclusion in her dissertation. I have attached copies of the co-authored publications that will be 
included in &lt;Delilah's&gt; dissertation, along with a copy of a letter of
support from Dr &lt;Publishalot&gt;.Sincerely,Dr. Philip. D. AdvisorUniversity of California, BerkeleyEncl:Gradstudent, D.A., Publishalot, C.V., Advisor, P.D.., 2003.
