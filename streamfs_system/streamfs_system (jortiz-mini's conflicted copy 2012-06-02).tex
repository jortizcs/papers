% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of

% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'

% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.

% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names

% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\section{Physical-data applications}
Physical-data applications are applications built to provide insight about the physical world.  They range from
analytics and visualization to control and actuation.  Analytics and visualization apps typically 
provide aggregates, statistical summaries, and future predictions about the behavior of the physical phenomenon 
being measured.  The fundamental challenges for these application are dealing with flawed or missing sensor data,
integrating smoothing and processing models to fill in gaps in the data, and maintaining consistency
between the physical world and the representation of it within the processing system, particular as it evolves.  
\emph{Context maintainence} is a fundamental challenge for correct interpretation of the physical data.

Control applications allow users to control their environment.  Control applications are either built off
analytics, providing intelligent, model-based control or they can provide simple, local, direct actuation by users 
through item or context-specific user interfaces.

Security is also a major concern in physical-data applications.  Physical data reveals personal information
about users through their affect on physical measurements.  For example, light sensors and location information
indicates occupation.  Energy-consumption aggregates, when grouped by user or localtion can give information about
the energy consumption habbits the occupants or users of those spaces.

\section{Subscription semantics}
A subscription expresses the intent to receive all associated streams whose topic is expressed by its hardlink name
or any associated alias.  Fundamentally, the subscriber expresses an interest in specific streams, referred to
directly by name or indirectly by topic matching as it pertains to regular-expression name matching.

\subsection{Continuous group-by for aggregation}
Many of the application queries require aggregation of data over groups of streams.  However, membership to those groups
change over time, so aggregate recalculation must account for the changing constituents in order to maintain accuracy.
Because of the way subscriptions are implemented in StreamFS, this is handled automatically.  Recall, only 
streams whose tags match a subscriber's regular expression is forwarded to the subscription target.  By removing 
a tag, you change group membership.  Tag removal \emph{can} change the membership of a stream to a group of streams
defined by the regular expression.  The data from streams belonging to the group are no longer accounted for in the aggregate
calculation.  The same is true when new members join the group.  Aggregate calculation accuracy is maitained
in either case.

Lets go through an example.

\section{Stream processing}
StreamFS allows users to perform stream processing on collections of streams.

Preserving timing semantics is challenging for two reasons:

\begin{enumerate}
\item NodeJs is single threaded; although it's an implementation issues, it's clear that
the scheduler can only handle one job at a time, so threading is necessary
\item load is a metric of cpu activity, but the real metric we care about is expected versus
actual start and completion time of a job.
\end{enumerate}

The second point is the important factor that determines when a job gets moved to another server.
We aim to maximize CPU utilization on a single server, without sacrificing timing constraints specified
by the user.  Job execution timing quality is measured by the absolute deviation of the completion
time of a job from the scheduled completion time, that quality measure degrades as computing cycles
become more scarce.  In other words, the less cpu cycles there are to schedule the CPU-bound job, the
larger the average error and variance of job completion times.

Now I have to show this experimentally and describe the methodology and job scheduling/migration algorithm.

\subsection{Job scheduling and migration}
Lets assume we have a job $J$ that takes $T_{c}$ to complete is scheduled to run every $T_{p}$ seconds.

\section{Filesystem for streaming data}
% Files provide an abstraction over collection of bytes on disk.  The file provides an interface where
% bytes are disk are logically sequential, allowing applications to refer to collections of bytes given an
% offset and length.  In the traditional case, bytes are physically distributed throughout the disk.  As data
% is read/written from the file, it is done so relative to the starting byte of the file, sequentially.
% In a sense, the file abstraction is convenient for dealing with distributed data.  Although (in most cases)
% locally on disk, sequential access interfaces for the application make it easier to browse, edit, 
% and acess the information without thinking about where the bytes are actually laid out.

% In a similar sense we think that interface can also serve as a convenient access abstraction.  Timeseries
% data gives us

A file system provides an abstraction for managing a collection of bytes on disk.  The standard file itself
provides logically sequential access to bytes distributed through the disk.  Directories provides a simple
container mechanism for grouping together files that are in some way related to each other.  We think deployment
metadata and data can similarly benefit from a simple hiearchical naming structure.  Grouping items that share
overlapping name-elements separated by forward-slashes in their tags.  It provides a simple
way to specify groups of streams as the unit of access or processing.  File systems have also developed
a convenient set of tools for quickly locating information, sharing reading, and pipelining processing; simple
tools that fit the access, sharing, and processing needs for local-area sensor deployments.  Filesystem also
provide a security model baked into their construction.  We examine the filesystem interface to StreamFS and 
examine how well the interface fits the needs for the class of applications StreamFS supports.


\subsection{Naming and access}
For local-area deployments, where spatial or categorical referral patterns are common in the tagging structure, 
hierarchical grouping provides a good, simple fit for naming objects.  However, we separate logical grouping from physical, 
and by doing so, also separate naming and access.  This prevents overly-stringent access patterns that may degrades 
performance over time.  How the data is accessed is independent of how the object named.  It also support multiple names without
affecting without affecting access.

Tags are abitrary, but forward-slash separated naming conventions map cleanly into a filesystem naming.  Each 
string between the forward slashes is treated like a directory in the filesystem.  If a user attempts to 
create a file with an element in the name that is already set for a non-container object in StreamFS, then creation
of the file is not allowed.

\subsection{File types: directories, regular, special, pipes}

\subsection{Filesystem tools: grep, find, ls}

\section{Publish/subscribe model}
Eugster et al.~\cite{eugster}.

StreamFS uses a flexible flavor of the publish/subscribe model in order to support a wide range of applications.  
Publish/subscribe is necessary is physical data application development in order to scale and support many diverse 
applications over potentially thousands of raw and derived data streams.

The publish/subscribe model used in StreamFS provides mechanisms that enable a flexible combination of space, time,
and syncrhonization decoupling.  This enable StreamFS to support of a wide arrange of application requirements.

Our pub/sub engine is also tightly coupled with the namespaces expose to users, and this design choice allows an application
to control the space coupling between the publisher and the subscriber.

Raw timeseries data is always stored while the user can choose to store derived data.  Storage allows for synchronization decoupling,
since the publisher and consumer may produce/consume data indepdently of one another.
