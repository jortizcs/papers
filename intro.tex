\section{Introduction}
Green IT

Understand the energy consumption of a building and identify savings opportunities.

Identification of energy consuming devices that are correlated.
Uncover usage patterns of correlated device that are energy efficient.
Detect deviation from the energy efficient pattern and report to the user.

During the design of our application the first difficulty was to identify the set of devices that have related energy consumption.

This article focuses on this problem
