\section{Introduction}
Buildings consume an enourmous amount of energy in countries around the world.  In 
the Japan, 28\% of the energy produced in consumed in buildings~\cite{japanbuildings} while in the United 
States it is as high as 40\%~\cite{epabuildings}.  Moreover, studies show that between 30-80\% of it
is wasted~\cite{waste_science, next10_waste}.  Large commercial buildings are typically instrumented
with a large number of sensors measuring various aspects of building operation.  Atlhgouh typically
used to assure operational stability, they may also be used to measure, observe, and identify
instances of wasted use.

Identifying instances of wasted energy use is non-trivial.  System efficiency is defined as the ratio of the 
useful work done to the energy it consumes.  In the case of buildings, we define useful work as 
the energy used to support activities by the building's occupants.

This approach is very time consuming and simply does not scale.

Fundamentally we want to understand how and when devices are being used.  In particular, we are interested
in correlated patterns of usage in order to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Uncover potentially correlated usage patterns that lead to efficiencies.
\item Identify anomolies from normal usage patterns.  These often indicate instances of waste.
\item Provide a way to codify efficient or expected usage over time and identify deviations
		from specification.
\end{itemize}

% Green IT

% Understand the energy consumption of a building and identify savings opportunities.

% Identification of energy consuming devices that are correlated.
% Uncover usage patterns of correlated device that are energy efficient.
% Detect deviation from the energy efficient pattern and report to the user.

% During the design of our application the first difficulty was to identify the set of devices that have related energy consumption.

% This article focuses on this problem.

% Results:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Correlation is noisy and can't find inter-relationships between sensors
% 		with subtle differences.
% \item Underlying behavior should extract most-common denominator in comparing traces
% 		to observe truly correlated behavior.
% \item Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) can be used to compare underlying behavior after the
% 		removal of the dominant frequencies in the signal.
% \end{enumerate}

% \subsection{ideas}

% Future work:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item We can create a time-varying dependency graph to compare ``normal'' versus ``abnormal'' behavioral
% 		patterns in underlying use.
% \item We can codify ``normal'' or ``efficient'' graphs and compare with real graph constructs over time.
% \end{enumerate}

% Possible algorithms:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item find correlated and uncorrelated sensors
% \item construct correlation network where the nodes are the sensors and an edge implies correlation above
% 		threshold. (We can also construct the complement of that.)
% \end{enumerate}
