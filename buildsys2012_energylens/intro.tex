\section{Introduction}
Introduction: Towards fined-grained, personal, real-time physical data services in buildings with Mobile Phones

\subsection{Motivation} 
greater visibility and control of building environment can provide more incentives and opportunities to reduce energy consumption in buildings

Examples of these from previous work:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dashboards
\item Andrew’s lighting thing
\item Kamin’s thing
\item personalized energy attribution thing
\item BEMs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Generalized definition of physical data services}

\begin{itemize}
\item energy analytics
\item control
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Short-comings of related work}
not fined-grained enough, not personal, not real-time.

\subsection{main thesis}  
In order to provide fine-grained, personal, real-time services we need to address fundamental challenges in

\begin{itemize}
\item mobility and consistency management: tracking the movement of people and things over time and keeping track of how they are inter-related.
\item there are other challenges, but these are the ones addressed in this paper.
\end{itemize}
