\section{Future work and conclusion}
In this paper we examined some of the system challenges for deploying an infrastructure for enabling and energy analytics applications, 
and offered initial solutions.  The main challenges we encountered were due to mobility and consistency management.  We
see these as crucial barriers to provide the kinds of services described in Section~\ref{sec:vision}.
However, other challenges remain, particularly those related to scaling this to an entire buildings, integrating
more streaming data sources, and providing streaming analytics for immediate display to building occupants.
Furthermore, we see an opportunity to combine these with control in order to empower building occupants to take
control of their energy footprint.  The components of our archictecture are simple, and simplicity is important for scale and
generalizability.  We hope that with the right tools and information, people will be motivated to act, and large
energy waste and reduction can be achieved.
