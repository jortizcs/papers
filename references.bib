    abstract = {{T}he goals of the present contribution are twofold. {F}irst, we propose the use of a non-{G}aussian long-range dependent process to model {I}nternet traffic aggregated time series. {W}e give the definitions and intuition behind the use of this model. {W}e detail numerical procedures that can be used to synthesize artificial traffic exactly following the model prescription. {W}e also propose original and practically effective procedures to estimate the corresponding parameters from empirical data. {W}e show that this empirical model relevantly describes a large variety of {I}nternet traffic, including both regular traffic obtained from public reference repositories and traffic containing legitimate (flash crowd) or illegitimate ({DD}o{S} attack) anomalies. {W}e observe that the proposed model accurately fits the data for a wide range of aggregation levels. {T}he model provides us with a meaningful multiresolution (i.e., aggregation level dependent) statistics to characterize the traffic: the evolution of the estimated parameters with respect to the aggregation level. {I}t opens the track to the second goal of the paper: anomaly detection. {W}e propose the use of a quadratic distance computed on these statistics to detect the occurrences of {DD}o{S} attack and study the statistical performance of these detection procedures. {T}raffic with anomalies was produced and collected by us so as to create a controlled and reproducible database, allowing for a relevant assessment of the statistical performance of the proposed (modeling and detection) procedures.},
