In this paper we investigate the utility of emperical mode decomposition (EMD) to cluster sensor traces with
correlated readings.  By doing so we look to construct inter-device correlation models to uncover anomolies 
in concerted use that can lead to the minimization of wasted energy.  We find that correlation of the raw
data alone is unstable because of the underlying phenomena that drives the sensor readings.
We use a deployment over for 650 sensors in a 12-story building on a university campus and find
% some statistics to summarize how it compares with EMD + Correlation and how it relates to spatio-temporal
% relationships.
