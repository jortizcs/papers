\section{Notes}

Emperical mode decomposition (EMD); taking a timeseries signal and decomposing it into
the various frequencies that form a linear combination to reconstruct the original signal.


Why am I looking at this?
By find multi-timescale trends we can set up scheduling at various timescales to minimize the cost of
performing energy-consuming tasks.  For example, (think of a good example to fill in here.)


Where does correlation/causal analysis fit in here?
The fundamental assumption I am making is that we can shave load by identifying couple energy-conuming
acitivities and decoupling them by removing that dependence.  For example, (think of a good example here)


What about the analytics portion of this?
StreamFS should be doing aggregation at each node in the hiearchy and should be aggregating by unit.
The default interpolator should be linear, with options for changing it to something else.  The metadata
history aspect should have a section that accounts for dealing with the history associated with
the expression and executiong of analytical processes as well as metadata state.


\section{Live interactive analytics}
Lots of moving parts, how do we deal with streaming data, timestamp formats, data cleaning, and processing easily
and quickly.

Then we need to run the analysis historically, now, and project into the future.
