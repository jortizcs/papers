\section{The Build Environment}


Buildings consume an enormous amount of energy in countries around the world.  In 
Japan, 28\% of the energy produced is consumed in buildings~\cite{japanbuildings} while in the United 
States it is as high as 40\%~\cite{epabuildings}.  Moreover, studies show that between 30-80\% of it
is wasted~\cite{waste_science, next10_waste}.  Large commercial buildings are typically instrumented
with a large number of sensors measuring various aspects of building operation.  Although this data is
typically used to assure operational stability, they may also be used to measure, observe, and identify
instances of wasted use.
