\section{Process Management}

Processes are managed through the filesystem.  Our design is guided by the principal that everything is a file and
every entity is represented in the filesystem.  We used the term subscription and pipe interchangably, however, for 
explicit disambiguation, we define a subscription as a one-way forwarding process of stream data to an external
target.  A pipe is a type of subscription to a stream file from an instance of a process file.  The process can
be internal or external and \emph{always} has its output represented by a stream file.  The latter allows us
to construct processes chains that can be linked via their associated stream files.
This section discusses the difference between internal and external processing jobs.  In short, internal processing jobs
are written in javascript and managed within a StreamFS process-cluster manager.  An external processing job
is one that interacts with external code that creates the associated representational files for management 
of external jobs from a central location.
