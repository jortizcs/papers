\section{Summary}

In this chapter we discussed the file abstraction is more detail.  We presented the 4 different types of files and how they
are used in StreamFS.  We summarized their opertations and semantics as well.  We also discussed the challenges in dealing with
maintaining an accurate view of the metadata over time and presented 4 types of verification.
The last one is particularly important because we believe it is fundamental.

In the next chapter we will evaluate the architecture with respect to its system properties.  We explore these properties by
presenting applications that it support that could not be supported by legacy systems.
