\label{chap:naming}

% From our experience with building applications, there are a clear set of requirements that are necessary.  
Most applications
construct the notion of context using the naming convention ascribed to a sensor stream.  The name conflates the notion of system,
space, and type information.  At the very least, these three should be supported, however, often other categorical needs must be
met to perform various kinds of aggregate statistical, analytics, and control.  In addition, we need to support the management of
processing jobs that process stream data and provide integrated management facilities for them.

Building applications are essentially monitoring and control applications built on the streams generated by sensors embedded through
the building or distillates of them.  As the number of applications and streams increased, it becomes desireable to manage them 
in a centralized fashion.  Moreover, the centralized apporach allows all applications to make use of a uniform naming convention and
can allow applications to be interoperable.  Systems that wish to support such applications require the following properties:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Logically accessible physical resources.
\item Representation of data producing and data consuming elements.
\item Representation of inter-relationships between elements.
\item Provide uniform naming and access.
\end{enumerate}

 
% We also discuss the incorporation of a pipe-like mechanism for 
% processing streams and their output.
