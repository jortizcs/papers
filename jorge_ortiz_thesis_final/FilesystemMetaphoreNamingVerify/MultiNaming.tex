\section{Supporting Multiple Names}

One of the goals of the naming scheme in StreamFS was the support multiple names for sensor and actuators.  The inclusion of symlinks
allows provides this ability.  A file can be names and linked to from multiple hierarchies.  This allows applications to refer
to the same physical entity with a unique object id through multiple names.  It is also used by our pub-sub system when
the names are resolved and play a crucial role in \emph{dynamic aggregation}.

The naming scheme are mainly used to express different kinds of organizational patterns for the sensors and their data.
However, the building goes through some changes and evolution which can causes they names to be physically incorrect.  In the next
section we discuss the mathematical tools we used to verify that the groups specified by the naming convention are correct.
