FIAP~\cite{fiap} is a web-services architecture for exposes building-specific communication protocols.  It essentially services to
map BACnet and/or LonTalk to an HTTP resource architecture.  It is not RESTful, however.  You must download and use a communication
stub in order to obtain resource information and related data.  Essentially it tunnels building protocols over HTTP.
Their approach to naming is ad-hoc and protocol specific, ours is also ad-hoc but we offer canonical constructions, allow 
the user to directly access the data through multiple interfaces -- including a RESTful one.

sMAP~\cite{smap} proposes a RESTful architecture for streaming sensor data.  Their resource-oriented architecture defines a 
hiearchical resource structure for a sensor or actuator and provides facilities for reading and writing that data RESTfully.
In contrast, they do not take a file system approach and only focus on sensor and actuators.  They leave the processing jobs
as a function outside of sMAP.  Also, by adopting filesystem constructs, we support multi-naming through symlinks -- a 
crucial feature that is missing from either of these.

% They also rely on pub-sub but only to serve external targets.  We make it a central component
% in our architecture
