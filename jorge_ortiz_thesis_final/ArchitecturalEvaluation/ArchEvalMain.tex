\chapter{Example Applications and API}
\label{chap:ArchEvalMain}

In this chapter we present an architectural evaluation through one of the 7 applications implemented on StreamFS.
The name of the application is the \emph{Mobile Energy Lens}.  It was designed to collect building inventory and metering
information and provide various live, aggregate view of the energy consumption of devices throughout the buidling.
The application makes use of several StreamFS features and provides a working, real-world example one of our target
emerging applications.
We start with a quick overview of the of the StreamFS API and then give a detailed overview of the motivation for
the Energy Lens application, components and architecture.  We highlight how StreamFS enables this class of applications
through its features and API.  For problems which StreamFS only provides a partial solution, we demonstrate how that partial
solution is extended into a full solution design and we present the associated evaluation.
We also present a mounted Unix FS version of StreamFS towards the end of the chapter.  We describe its use in enabling 
the use of legacy applications and describe the translation of StreamFS file operational semantics to Unix filesystem
operational semantics.
