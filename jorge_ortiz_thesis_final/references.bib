    abstract = {{T}he goals of the present contribution are twofold. {F}irst, we propose the use of a non-{G}aussian long-range dependent process to model {I}nternet traffic aggregated time series. {W}e give the definitions and intuition behind the use of this model. {W}e detail numerical procedures that can be used to synthesize artificial traffic exactly following the model prescription. {W}e also propose original and practically effective procedures to estimate the corresponding parameters from empirical data. {W}e show that this empirical model relevantly describes a large variety of {I}nternet traffic, including both regular traffic obtained from public reference repositories and traffic containing legitimate (flash crowd) or illegitimate ({DD}o{S} attack) anomalies. {W}e observe that the proposed model accurately fits the data for a wide range of aggregation levels. {T}he model provides us with a meaningful multiresolution (i.e., aggregation level dependent) statistics to characterize the traffic: the evolution of the estimated parameters with respect to the aggregation level. {I}t opens the track to the second goal of the paper: anomaly detection. {W}e propose the use of a quadratic distance computed on these statistics to detect the occurrences of {DD}o{S} attack and study the statistical performance of these detection procedures. {T}raffic with anomalies was produced and collected by us so as to create a controlled and reproducible database, allowing for a relevant assessment of the statistical performance of the proposed (modeling and detection) procedures.},

    Abstract = {This paper examines the argument for dataflow architectures in "Two Fundamental Issues in Multiprocessing." We observe two key problems. First, the justification of extensive multithreading is based on an overly simplistic view of the storage hierarchy. Second the local greedy scheduling policy embodied in dataflow is inadequate in many circumstances. A more realistic model of the storage hierarchy imposes significant constraints on the scheduling of computation and requires a degree of parsimony in the scheduling policy. In particular, it is important to establish a scheduling hierarchy that reflects the underlying storage hierarchy. However, even with this improvement, simple local scheduling policies are unlikely to be adequate.  <p>Keywords: dataflow, multiprocessing, multithreading, latency tolerance, storage hierarchy, scheduling hierarchy}

    Abstract = {We describe Viptos (Visual Ptolemy and TinyOS), an integrated graphical development and simulation environment for TinyOS-based wireless sensor networks.  TinyOS is a component-based, event-driven runtime environment designed for wireless sensor networks.  Viptos allows networked embedded systems developers to construct block and arrow diagrams to create TinyOS programs from any standard library of TinyOS components written in nesC, a C-based programming language. Viptos automatically transforms the diagram into a nesC program that can be compiled and downloaded from within the graphical environment onto any TinyOS-supported target platform.  Viptos is built on Ptolemy II, a modeling and simulation environment for embedded systems, and TOSSIM, an interrupt-level discrete event simulator for homogeneous TinyOS networks.  In particular, Viptos includes the full capabilities of VisualSense, a Ptolemy II environment that can model communication channels, networks, and non-TinyOS nodes.  Viptos extends the capabilities of TOSSIM to allow simulation of heterogeneous networks. Viptos provides a bridge between VisualSense and TOSSIM by providing interrupt-level simulation of actual TinyOS programs, with packet-level simulation of the network, while allowing the developer to use other models of computation available in Ptolemy II for modeling the physical environment and other parts of the system.  This framework allows application developers to easily transition between high-level simulation of algorithms to low-level implementation and simulation.  This paper presents our experiences with integrating the nesC/TinyOS/TOSSIM and Ptolemy II programming and execution models.}

    Abstract = {This volume describes how to construct Ptolemy II models for web-based modeling or building applications. The first chapter includes an overview of Ptolemy II software, and a brief description of each of the models of computation that have been implemented. It describes the package structure of the software, and includes as an appendix a brief tutorial on UML notation, which is used throughout the documentation to explain the structure of the software. The second chapter is a tutorial on building models using Vergil, a graphical user interface where models are built pictorially. The third chapter discusses the Ptolemy II expression language, which is used to set parameter values. The next chapter gives an overview of actor libraries. These three chapters, plus one of the domain chapters, will be sufficient for users to start building interesting models in the selected domain. The fifth chapter gives a tutorial on designing actors in Java. The sixth chapter describes the Ptolemy coding style, The seventh chapter explains MoML, the XML schema used by Vergil to store models. And the eighth chapter, the final one in this part, explains how to construct custom applets. 

<p>Volume 2 describes the software architecture of Ptolemy II, and volume 3 describes the domains, each of which implements a model of computation.}

    abstract = {{T}he goals of the present contribution are twofold. {F}irst, we propose the use of a non-{G}aussian long-range dependent process to model {I}nternet traffic aggregated time series. {W}e give the definitions and intuition behind the use of this model. {W}e detail numerical procedures that can be used to synthesize artificial traffic exactly following the model prescription. {W}e also propose original and practically effective procedures to estimate the corresponding parameters from empirical data. {W}e show that this empirical model relevantly describes a large variety of {I}nternet traffic, including both regular traffic obtained from public reference repositories and traffic containing legitimate (flash crowd) or illegitimate ({DD}o{S} attack) anomalies. {W}e observe that the proposed model accurately fits the data for a wide range of aggregation levels. {T}he model provides us with a meaningful multiresolution (i.e., aggregation level dependent) statistics to characterize the traffic: the evolution of the estimated parameters with respect to the aggregation level. {I}t opens the track to the second goal of the paper: anomaly detection. {W}e propose the use of a quadratic distance computed on these statistics to detect the occurrences of {DD}o{S} attack and study the statistical performance of these detection procedures. {T}raffic with anomalies was produced and collected by us so as to create a controlled and reproducible database, allowing for a relevant assessment of the statistical performance of the proposed (modeling and detection) procedures.},
