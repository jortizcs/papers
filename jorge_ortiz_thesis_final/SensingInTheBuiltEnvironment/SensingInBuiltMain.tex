\chapter{Sensing in the Built Environment}

Buildings consume nearly 40\% of the total energy produced in the United States and 72\% of the electricity.  Similar figures 
have been recorded in other industrialized countries~\cite{buildings_study}.  Furthermore, studies show that they waste from
30-80\% of the energy they consume.  With specter of global warming and the continued decrease in the cost of storage and 
communication, buildings have become a major target for improved energy efficiency.

Large commercial buildings typically contain thousands of sensors embedded in them which report periodic readings to 
a centralized system called a building management system.  Typically these have been installed for supervisory control and
centralized observation of the building.  The kinds of sensors installed including temperature sensors on the thermostats,
valve position meters and actuators on pipes, pressure sensors in the vents, temperature sensors on the vents and pipes, etc.
These readings are combined with a graphical interface for building managers to visually locate them according to their location.
The interface also allows them to visually inspect and quickly try to diagnose a problem, typically in response to occupant
complaints.

Although these systems have been revolutionary from a building management perspective, they lack many fundamental components for
truly enabling sophisticated analysis -- the kind of analysis that is needed to understand how the building is performing
and will perform in the future.  Also, building practices for software-driven building systems serve more as guideline than
 as a standard.  This presents major challenges with respect to software re-use and scalability.  In this thesis
we will discuss the how we address these challenges through architectural design choices and analytical metholodology.  
The achitectural choices reconstruct the software layer that sits on top of existing building management systems and presents
a unified interface and standard API for analytical and control building applications.
The analytical methodology offers a general approach to verifying the construction of point names -- the naming scheme for 
sensors distributed throughout the building.  Both set a foundation for ongoing and future work.

The thesis is presented in the context of building systems and building-related applications.  We draw out the fundamental 
components in our analysis and design and discuss where it fits in the broader context of prior, computer science related,
literature.  In the next section, we describe the state-of-the-art practices followed by vendors of building information systems.
We describe the architecture features and design principals both implicitly and explicitly implemented into these systems.
We present the pros and cons of these decisions and their implications and include a high-level description of our approach.
Later chapters delve more deeply into the implications of our design decisions.
