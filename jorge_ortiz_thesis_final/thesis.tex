I want to thank my advisor, David Culler, for guiding my research work and giving me the
freedom to choose my own problems and go deep.  David has an amazing ability to provide  
deep insights to any problem and has helped guide my vision in 
the context of all the established work, while fearlessly pushing me to examine completely new domains.

 % Aileen Cruz, Judy Zamora, Rudy Ortiz, Lilia Fajardo, Patty Rivera
I want to thank my wife Aileen Cruz, my mother and father, Judy Zamora and Rudy Ortiz, my 
grandmother Lilia Fajardo and my sister Patricia Rivera.  They have supported me throughout my entire career in ways
that are too long to list here. I spoke to my family almost every day since I moved to California in 2005, and they
have been with me throughout; separated by many miles but never closer.  Aileen offered unwavering confidence in me since 
my years at M.I.T., my arduous transition from Oracle to Berkeley, 
and for all my years in the program.  We arrived as two and leave as a family of four, with our baby Elias on the way and 
our wonderful dog Juani.  

A special thanks to Professor Randy Katz, for always being encouraging, offering deep insights, and 
excellent baseball conversation.  Ever the die-hard SF Giants fan, I will always remember the games we attended
at AT\&T Park and our discussions about the statistics of the game.
I also want to thank Processor Paul Wright for giving me great feedback during my qualifying exam that guided the direction
of the work from its inception.
I want to thank my colleagues David Zats, Dezhi Hong, and Romain Fontugne for the work we did together.  I will cherish my 
interactions with them and I am
happy to call them friends.  I also want to thank Michael Andersen for his feedback on my dissertation and taking the time to
find grammatical errors throughout.  
A special thanks goes to Jay Taneja, Prabal Dutta, Jaein Jeong, Fred Xiang, Sukun Kim and Arsalan 
Tavokoli, the original wireless
embedded systems group.  Jay, without your pushing me to sit in 410, I might not have had to opportunity to be 
as productive as I was those early years.  Prabal, thank you for all those long conversations, early guidance, and helpful advice.  
He served as the kind of
mentor I hope every person gets to have at some point in their career.

I also want to thank Professors Ion Stoica and Scott Shenker, for giving me those early opportunities to transition from an employee
at Oracle to a PhD student at Berkeley. To Rodrigo Fonseca, Chris Baker, Daekeong Moon, Jinyang Li, Joel Weinberger,
Michael Heinrich, Jonathan Chang and
Professor Hiroshi Esaki.  Thank you for patiently working with me and giving me an opportunity to succeed.  
A very special thanks to Albert Goto, for our long talks and for all your help throughout my time at Berkeley.  
An extended
thank you to Larry Rudolph at M.I.T. and Josh Jacobs at Drexel, who got me started on research many years ago, while I was at M.I.T.

Finally, I want to thank the organizations that funded the work in this thesis.  These include the National Science Foundation,
Samsung, Intel, and Nokia.

To \emph{the block} in Woodside, Queens.  
% You played a big role in who I have become.  I have always
